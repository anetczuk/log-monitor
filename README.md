# log-monitor

Parse log files and expose data in form of RSS feed.

Application provides RSS channel for content parsed from log files.
RSS provided by the application can be used for example in *Thunderbird* or other feed reader.

Typical use case consists of running application on remote machine (e.g. RPi on LAN) and configure feed reader 
to receive the feed, so crytical logs can be received without additional effort.


## Running

[There](doc/cmdargs.md) is description of command line arguments.

To run application simply execute followoing command:
```
python3 -m logmonitor start -c <apth-to-config.toml>
```

As result application will be started with additional icon in system tray allowing to simple control over the application.

Then generated RSS data can be imported to any feed reader using file directly or URL, e.g:
- `file:///<path-to-data-root>/<parser-id>/<feed-name-file>` 
- `http://<server-address>/<parser-id>/<feed-name-file>`

where `<path-to-data-root>` is configurable in config file, `<parser-id>` and 
`<feed-name-file>` are defined for each `RSSGenerator` (log parser) and `<server-address>` is IP or hostname of machine with 
running application.

If use case is to just generate RSS data then execute following:
```
python3 -m logmonitor generate -c <apth-to-config.toml>
```


## Installation

Installation of package can be done by:
 - to install package from downloaded ZIP file execute: `pip3 install --user -I file:log-monitor-master.zip#subdirectory=src`

 - `install-devel.sh` to install package in developer mode using `pip` (with dependencies)


## Config file

There is [example configuration file](examples/config_example.yaml) in examples. It has following content:

<!-- insertstart include="examples/config_example.yaml" pre="\n\n```\n" post="\n```\n\n" -->

```
# configuration file

general:
    startupdelay: 15           # set delay in seconds before first generation (useful on startup to wait for KeePassXC to start before) 
    startserver: true          # set 'false' to prevent starting RSS server (just store data to local files), default: true
    icontheme: "black"         # color theme of tray icon: black or white
    port: 8080                 # RSS feed port, default 8080
    refreshtime: 3600          # time in seconds between consecutive RSS generator loop iterations, default 3600
    dataroot: "data"           # path to store data; path absolute or relative to config directory
                               # default value is app dir inside user home directory

```

Fields are quite self-descriptive.

Some fields are common for config file and command-line arguments. In such cases command-line version has precedence 
over values in the file (overrides values taken from config file).
